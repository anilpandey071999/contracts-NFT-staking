# ðŸŽ© Contracts NFT staking: The Magical Adventure ðŸŽ©
Get ready to embark on an enchanting journey through the land of `Contracts GPT`! With our trusty sidekicks, `Hardhat` and `Foundry`, we'll create spellbinding smart contracts that will captivate and delight!

Before we begin, let's call upon the mystical powers of `Foundry` with these incantations in your enchanted terminal:
```shell 
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup --branch master
```

Now that we've summoned `Foundry`, it's time to unlock the secrets of the `Contracts NFT staking` repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/CryptoGPTorg/contracts-NFT-staking.git
cd contracts-NFT-staking
npm install
```

With our trusty wand, let's weave a spell to compile our magical contracts:
```shell
npx hardhat compile
```

Next, let's put our creation to the test! Unleash the power of your spells with:
```shell
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
```
